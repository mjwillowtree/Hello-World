# COMPETITOR_LANDSCAPE (Onboarding + Plan-Management Focus)

Updated: 2026-03-11

Scope: onboarding/servicing workflows (not portfolio performance).

## Snapshot table

| Provider / Program | Workflow signal | User friction / risk | Evidence | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fidelity ABLE | Supports 60-day rollover and program-to-program transfer workflows for ABLE/529 into ABLE | High operational risk if earnings/principal documentation is missing; signature complexity can increase abandonment | Official rollover/transfer request form | High |
| ABLE for ALL | Direct 529->ABLE rollover with same-beneficiary or family-member certification and multi-party signatures | Relationship/attestation errors can trigger rejection or nonqualified risk | Official direct rollover form | High |
| Texas ABLE | Distinguishes direct vs indirect rollovers and requires support docs for earnings/contributions | Without support docs, full rollover can be treated as earnings | Official incoming rollover form | High |
| ABLEnow | Public form resources for incoming 529->ABLE and indirect rollover flows | Form-first operational flow likely creates similar checklist/drop-off patterns | Forms + workflow pages | Medium |
| ABLE United | ABLE-to-ABLE rollover form enforces same-beneficiary/family restrictions, 12-month frequency control, and source-account closure timing | Source account not closed within 60 days can break qualified treatment; notarization may be required by source program | Official ABLE-to-ABLE rollover form | High |

## Detail notes

### Fidelity ABLE
- Requires principal/earnings documentation for rollover classification; missing docs can force conservative earnings treatment until corrected.
- Includes signature operations and additional signature guarantee requirements in specified cases.

### ABLE for ALL

### Texas ABLE
- States 60-day qualification rules and required support documentation.
- Warns that absent earnings/contributions documentation, the full rollover may be treated as earnings.

### ABLEnow
- Public resources show dedicated forms/processes for direct and indirect rollover intake.

### ABLE United
- Rollover form states the old ABLE account should be closed within 60 days, otherwise the new account may not be treated as qualified for tax and means-tested benefits purposes.
- Form also flags potential notarization requirements by the old program manager and 12-month rollover frequency constraints for same-beneficiary rollovers.

## Product-intelligence implications

1. Form-first operations remain standard for rollover execution.
2. Beneficiary/family-member mapping is a core failure point.
3. Earnings-basis documentation is a repeated cross-provider risk control.
4. Signature/notarization/guarantee variance should be surfaced pre-submission.
5. 60-day controls are not only funding clocks; some administrators also require source-account closure evidence to preserve qualified treatment.
