## 7) Adversarial: Can we auto-approve transfers if names match?
**Answer:** No. Cap checks, relationship logic, documentation, and state treatment still must pass.  
**Confidence:** High

**Confidence:** High  
**Sources:**  
- `outputs/HUB.md`  
- `outputs/STATE_MATRIX.csv`

## 9) In Indiana, does a 529->ABLE rollover always trigger state credit recapture?
**Answer:** Not always. Indiana return instructions and recapture schedules clearly map where recapture is posted, but current materials show filing-year nuance: older form text broadly treats ABLE transfers as nonqualified, while Jan-2026 DOR Bulletin #98 states that for 2024+ transfers to an Indiana ABLE 529A plan are qualified for credit-recapture purposes (with other ABLE transfers remaining nonqualified).  
**Confidence:** Medium-High

## 10) Should product UX pre-check Medallion Signature Guarantee requirements?
**Answer:** Yes. Official PA ABLE rollover instructions state that source program managers may require a Medallion Signature Guarantee and that missing a required guarantee can delay the rollover.
