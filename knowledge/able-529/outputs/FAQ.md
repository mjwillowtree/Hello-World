## 7) Adversarial: Can we auto-approve transfers if names match?
**Answer:** No. Cap checks, relationship logic, documentation, and state treatment still must pass.  
**Confidence:** High  
**Sources:**

- `outputs/STATE_MATRIX.csv`

## 8) Are all 50-state line-level rules complete?
**Answer:** No. Matrix coverage exists for all jurisdictions, but many rows are still low-confidence placeholders.  
**Confidence:** High  
**Sources:**  
- `outputs/HUB.md`  
- `outputs/STATE_MATRIX.csv`

## 9) In Utah, where is my529 add-back reported and what triggers it?
**Answer:** Utah instructions place my529 add-back on TC-40A Part 1 (code 54), with the Part 1 total carried to TC-40 line 5. The add-back applies when funds are withdrawn and not used for qualified education expenses, and the withdrawal does not meet an IRC 529(c)/530(d) exception, to the extent of prior Utah tax benefit.  
**Confidence:** Medium-High

## 10) Adversarial: Are 529->ABLE transfers always exempt from ABLE annual contribution limits?
**Answer:** No. Operational forms can enforce annual-limit checks for 529->ABLE transfers; for example, ABLEnow explicitly states the transfer amount may not exceed the annual contribution limit.  
**Confidence:** High

## 11) What post-submission workflow risk is now clearly evidenced?
**Answer:** If source-plan basis/earnings documentation is not delivered in time, transfer tax classification can degrade after submission (ABLEnow form states a 60-day documentation window, after which full balance may be treated as earnings).
